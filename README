This is my attempt at making video poker simulations/analysis.
The base was taken from Eric Farmer-s Video Poker, but in the end I will be 
re-writing every part of code due to some specific needs.

This should be used to find RTP (return %) of poker games (it's Math tool, not a game with GUI).
One mode will be Monte-Carlo simulation (random cards and do it for many many times),
but more usefull to me is analysis by constructing every possible video poker game.  
In video poker only the first 10 cards can have effect on game outcome, 5 are in first hand
and max 5 more if all 5 from first hand are discarded.

I have to re-write all the code because I need to impliment many different variants of video poker.
For example, the code used in Eric Farmer-s video poker has no Joker cards, that are needed for
some video poker variants.

For now card deck is standard 52 cards, but I will add Jokers (1-4) in the future.
